# Next.js Frontend Boilerplate

A lightweight next.js front-end boilerplate that's similar to my old PHP gulp setup.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

* Node.js.  Current LTS should be good.

### Installing

`yarn install` to install. `yarn dev` for dev mode.  `yarn build` to build, and `yarn start` to start production server.  

Oh, and `yarn export` to export static assets to the out folder.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License, since Next and React are also MIT, why mess with perfection?

## Acknowledgments

* Pretty much just a rip of the Next.js tutorial
* A few tools for processing scss and the like
